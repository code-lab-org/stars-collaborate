Simulation Library for Autonomous and Collaborative Satellite Sensor Networks

** Motivation
   Future Earth-observation missions will involve intelligent networks of
   diverse sensor platforms which coordinate to make Earth observations.

   Small satellite constellations and new science instruments will facilitate
   high-density /(faster revisit time)/ and multi-dimensional /(temporal and
   spatial)/ measurements.

   *Collaborative communication* is key to enabling coordinated observations.

   *Challenge* -- Adaptive remote sensing with constrained resources introduces
   a complex decision-making space.

   *Questions* -- How do we maximize the science return from measurements?  How
   do we prepare for the next-generation of Earth observation missions?

   *Approach* -- New simulation tools -- a software library for adaptive and
   collaborative observing-system simulation experiments /(OSSEs)/.

   _New Software Library Features_
   - Rapid simulation development and constellation design
   - Coordination among diverse sensor platforms
   - Facilitate algorithm development /(adaptive sensor reconfiguration, system
     resource management, delay-tolerant networking)/
   - Produce simulation data /(events, telemetry, networking, etc.)/
   - Open-source, modular, and freely available for integration with larger
     OSSEs
** What is COLLABORATE?
   *Open Source (GPL) Software Package*

   _Three Main Components_
   1. *C++ Library*
      - Code for developing novel observing-system simulation experiments
   2. *C++ Example Programs*
      - Demonstrate library capabilities
      - Execute these to produce /Simulation Result Files/
   3. *Python Utilities*
      - Process /Simulation Result Files/ \rightarrow /Analysis Files/
      - Open-source third-party packages /(Pandas, Cartopy, NetCDF, Matplotlib,
        Numpy, etc.)/
** COLLABORATE C++ Library
   *Functional Capabilities*
   - Use classes to create objects /(object-oriented)/
   - Propagate physical position and orientation of satellites
   - Model realistic communication links, routes, and sensing
